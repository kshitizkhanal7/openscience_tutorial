## ICIS 2018 Pre-Conference Workshop

*Time*: 8:30AM - 4:30PM

*Place*: Commonwealth AB (2nd floor)

### Instructors

[Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/), Stanford University

### Pre-workshop Setup

This workshop will be hands-on throughout! That means you need to install some software: 

* [This link](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) goes to a tutorial program (Swirl) which begins by walking you through the process of downloading R and RStudio. If you have never interacted with a terminal/command line before, you might find it helpful to go through just the first few lessons of the 'Basics of R Programming' series, as well. If you have difficulty getting these installed on your laptop, we'll be on hand right before the workshop for troubleshooting!

* Make an account on the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io).
