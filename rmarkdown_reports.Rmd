```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
source("intro_to_ggplot2.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


later, we will put code to make figures down here!

<!-- eb: some setting is off, when i knit before it made but then deleted an rmarkwdown_reports_files directory,
can't figure it out right now, wanna show folks the .png file that gets rendered-->
```{r, graph, echo=F}
ggplot(data = ps_data_byitem_cond)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=condition,
                           y =sum_corr))

```
